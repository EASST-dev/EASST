# FASE Charter

## Preamble
At the meeting of the Board of the European Association for Software Science and Technology (EASST) in April 2004 in Barcelona, it was decided to form a Steering Committee (SC) for the International Conference on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering (FASE). This charter establishes the rules and guidelines to be followed by the SC and the Programme Committee (PC) Chairs of FASE.

## 1. Scope
FASE is one of the main conferences of the annual European Joint Conferences on Theory and Application of Software (ETAPS). FASE is dedicated to all scientific, methodological and foundational aspects of any topic in software engineering (testing, verification, specification, etc.). The PC Chairs will interpret this scope in a more precise way, focusing on the current interests and trends of the software engineering community.

## 2. Steering Committee
The role of the Steering Committee is to provide institutional memory, oversight, and strategic guidance for the FASE Conference series.

## 3. Programme Committee Chairs
### 3.1 Responsibilities
The tasks of the PC Chairs are the following, in the given order:

- In case of co-chairs, decide who will be a member of the ETAPS SC for each of the three years of appointment.
- Submit the following three proposals to the FASE SC:
  - A list of PC members, including some possible replacements in case some of the proposed members decline the invitation.
  - A call for papers
  - An invited speaker, indicating also a possible replacement.
- Once the FASE SC approves them, submit them to the ETAPS SC.
- Once the ETAPS SC approves them, start inviting the PC members and the speaker.
- Set up a website (and possibly a mailing list) for the conference and inform the ETAPS General Chair about it.
- Publicize the call for papers at appropriate meetings, mailing lists, newsletters, etc. in coordination with the ETAPS General Chair.
- Run the paper bidding and reviewing process.
- Nominate (in consultation with the PC) at most two papers for each of the ETAPS awards.
- Edit the proceedings in cooperation with Springer-Verlag.
- Distribute the selected papers among sessions and appoint session chairs.
- Write a brief report on the programme of FASE (including statistics on submitted and accepted papers/demos) and present it to the ETAPS SC at its annual meeting during ETAPS.
- Write a longer report including details and suggestions that are of interest to future FASE PC Chairs, and present it to the FASE SC at its annual meeting.

### 3.2 Guidelines
The PC Chairs should strive to follow the following recommended guidelines:

- The PC Chairs should ask the invited speaker to write a full paper for publication in the FASE proceedings and a brief report on FASE for publication in the EASST and SIGSOFT newsletters.
- In order to provide continuity and coherence among different editions:
  - About 50% of the PC members should be chosen among PC members of the previous two FASE editions.
  - The Chair (or co-chairs) of the previous edition should be invited for the PC.
  - The Chair (or co-chairs) of the next edition should be invited for the PC.
- The PC members should be representative of different countries (including some non-European ones) and research topics. More than one member of the same institution or research group is to be avoided.
- The PC should include at least 10% of members with industrial affiliation or background.
- The PC should include at least 20% of female members.
