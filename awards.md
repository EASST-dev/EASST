## Nominations For ICGT
<br>

To nominate an ICGT paper for the EASST, the PC chairs should consult with the programme committee and suggest a suitable paper to be awarded. The paper should be of high quality and within the scope of EASST.

 

The board will decide if these conditions are met and prepare a certificate to be handed over at the conference.
